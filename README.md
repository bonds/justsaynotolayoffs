# Why This List Exists

Some leaders say layoffs should be a ‘last resort’, but not all of them try equally hard to avoid them. I created this list to make it easier to find the companies that try harder. I don’t like layoffs and my hope is that the easier it is for employees to find and reward employers for saying ‘no’ to layoffs, the fewer layoffs we’ll have.

# Evidence

1. Current leadership is on the record promising they don’t believe in layoffs and won’t do them. #promised
2. Keeps above average cash reserves for their industry—they can weather a storm. #prepared 
3. Slow and careful in their hiring. Good at performance management, firing low performers, and pruning low value projects. #disciplined 
4. Been around for a while, been through tough times (for them), and haven’t laid people off. Actions speak louder than words. #record
